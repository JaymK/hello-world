This is my software development journey:
===============================================

I taught myself typing in Form 2 using a friend's computer in the mid '90s. Because
I couldn't go with the computer home I made a sketch of the keyboard on a piece of
paper and memorized the keyboard in a single night! Believe it or not in less than a fortnight
I was typing 40 wpm!

After high school and just before I joined university, I took a computer course (just to get me out of home)
and that's where I truly fell in love with computers. After quickly going through the school's
curriculum I taught myself MS-DOS and a little HTML and I was hooked.

I went to university where I did a business course but deep inside I longed to learn programming. However, I never got
the chance and thought it best to forget the dream and concentrate on jobs and courses in the finance world.

Unfortunately for me, a career as a corporate wannabe didn't work out and I found myself teaching Math in high school. During my
spare time however I would crack at the basics of programming and through various online platforms such as Lynda.com, Harvard
Edx program and Youtube, I acquired enough web development skills to start a web development business and made
a living of it.

Even after mastering PHP, HTML5+CSS3 and MySQL and making several websites for a number of clients I yearned to make educational
applications to help students and fellow teachers. One day while describing to a relative what I'd like to build one day they
advised me to learn Python+Django Framework.

It took me a year to learn Python but after that I made an educational application using Python that has paid my bills for the
last 4 years! People are often surprised when they learn that I've no formal Computer Science training when they see or use the
application I developed.

It's been a difficult but a very exciting journey ladies and gentlemen but it's been totally worth it. My mind goes to a wonderful
place everytime I'm solving a problem using the magic of programming.

When I applied for Google African Challenge Scholarship I had the option of picking something that I was very familiar with to
increase my chances of landing the Nano-degree scholarship but I didn't. I opted to study something I was not comfortable with
because that's the next level of my programming journey.

I must also confess that many of my Python+Django App clients requested that I convert the application into Android for better
distribution of the service. So here I am.

I thank the folks at Google, Udacity and Andela Learning Community for according me the opportunity to be taught and learn
Android Dev with the very best. You've set the path for me, the journey does not end here, it has just began.

Thank you very much and God bless you all.
