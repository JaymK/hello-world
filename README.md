Github Mastery Course
Hi Fellow Coders,

My name is Jimmy. I'm an android developer and student in Udacity. I'm fluent in Python, SQL and Java. I've working understanding of PHP and Ruby although I love Python and Java the best.

This is for Github Udacity Course by the way so I should probably be brief and go back to it.
Cheers.
